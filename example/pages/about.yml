      title: What is Page Constructor Builder?
      text: |
        Page Constructor Builder is a command-line utility that leverages the power of 
        [@gravity-ui/page-constructor](https://github.com/gravity-ui/page-constructor) 
        to build static websites from simple YAML configurations.

        ## How it Works

        1. **YAML Configuration**: Write your page content in simple YAML files
        2. **Component Processing**: The tool processes built-in and custom components
        3. **Bundle Creation**: Webpack bundles all assets and dependencies
        4. **Static Generation**: HTML pages are generated with React hydration
        5. **Ready to Deploy**: Output is a complete static website
